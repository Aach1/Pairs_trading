# Pairs Trading

A pairs trading strategy is one of the most popular strategies when it comes to finding trading opportunities between the two stocks that are co-integrated.
A pair of stocks is traded in a market-neutral strategy, i.e. it doesnâ€™t matter whether the market is trending upwards or downwards, the two open positions for each stock hedge against each other. The key challenges in pairs trading are to:
  1) Select a pair which will give you good statistical arbitrage opportunities over time
  2) Select the entry/exit points
